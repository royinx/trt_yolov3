# About This Sample
This Python sample demonstrates how to run YOLOv3-608[^1] (with an input size of 608x608 pixels - in the following just referred to as YOLOv3) in TensorRT 5.0, using ONNX-TensorRT (https://github.com/onnx/onnx-tensorrt).

First, the original YOLOv3 specification from the paper is converted to the
Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) format in `yolov3_to_onnx.py` (only has to
be done once).

Second, this ONNX representation of YOLOv3 is used to build a TensorRT engine  
in `onnx_to_tensorrt.py`, followed by inference on a sample image. The predicted
bounding boxes are finally drawn to the original input image and saved to disk.

Note that this sample is not supported on Ubuntu 14.04 and older.
Additionally, the `yolov3_to_onnx.py` does not support Python 3.

# Installing Prerequisites
1. Install ONNX-TensorRT.
2. Make sure you have the python dependencies installed.
    - For python2, run `python2 -m pip install -r requirements.txt` from the root directory of this sample.
    - For python3, run `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt` from the root directory of this sample.

# Running the Sample
1. Create an ONNX version of YOLOv3 with the following command - the Python
   script will also download all necessary files from the official mirrors
   (only once):
	```
		python yolov3_to_onnx.py
	```
	When running above command for the first time, the output should look like
	this:
	```

	[...]
	  %106_convolutional = Conv[auto_pad = u'SAME_LOWER', dilations = [1, 1],
	  kernel_shape = [1, 1], strides = [1, 1]](%105_convolutional_lrelu,
	  	%106_convolutional_conv_weights, %106_convolutional_conv_bias)
	  return %082_convolutional, %094_convolutional, %106_convolutional
	}
	```
2. After completing the first step, you can proceed to building a TensorRT
   engine from the generated ONNX file and running inference on a sample image
   (will also be downloaded during the first run). Run the second script with:
    ```
    python onnx_to_tensorrt.py
    ```
	Doing this for the first time should produce the following output:
	```
	Downloading from https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet/raw/f86901f6177dfc6116
